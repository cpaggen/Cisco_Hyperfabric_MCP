# Hyperfabric MCP tool

This project requires the HF OpenAPI spec and an API token to function correctly. To keep your token secure and out of version control, you'll need to create a `.env` file with HYPERFABRIC_API_TOKEN="eyJhbG...."

The tool parses the OpenAPI spec and automatically exposes all API endpoints as tools.
